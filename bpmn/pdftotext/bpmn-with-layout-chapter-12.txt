12.1 BPMN Diagram Interchange (BPMN DI)

12.1.1 Scope

This chapter specifies the meta-model and schema for BPMN 2.0 Diagram Interchange (BPMN DI). The BPMN DI is
meant to facilitate interchange of BPMN diagrams between tools rather than being used for internal diagram
representation by the tools. The simplest interchange approach to ensure the unambiguous rendering of a BPMN diagram
was chosen for BPMN DI. As such, BPMN DI does not aim to preserve or interchange any “tool smarts” between the
source and target tools (e.g., layout smarts, efficient styling, etc.).

BPMN DI does not address or define the interchange of color information. The use of alternative colors in BPMN is non
normative. The meaning or semantic of colors might vary from tool to tool or, from user to user, potentially leading to
miss-interpretations.

BPMN DI does not ascertain that the BPMN diagram is syntactically or semantically correct.

12.1.2 Diagram Definition and Interchange

The BPMN DI meta-model, similar to the BPMN abstract syntax meta-model, is defined as a MOF-based meta-model.
As such, its instances can be serialized and interchanged using XMI. BPMN DI is also defined by an XML schema. Thus
its instances can also be serialized and interchanged using XML.

Both, BPMN DI meta-model and schema are harmonized with a draft version of the OMG Diagram Definition (DD)
standard. Annex B contains the relevant parts of the referenced DD specifications that were used as foundation for the
BPMN DI model and schema. The provided DD contains two main parts: the Diagram Commons (DC) and the Diagram
Interchange (DI). The DC defines common types like bounds and fonts, while the DI provides a framework for defining
domain specific diagram models. As a domain specific DI, BPMN DI defines a few new meta-model classes that derive
from the abstract classes from DI.

The focus of BPMN DI is the interchange of laid out shapes and edges that constitute a BPMN diagram. Each shape and
edge references a particular BPMN model element. The referenced BPMN model elements are all part of the actual
BPMN model. As such, BPMN DI is meant to only contain information that is neither present, nor derivable, from the
BPMN model whenever possible. Simply put, to render a BPMN diagram both the BPMN DI instance(s) and the
referenced BPMN model are REQUIRED.

From the BPMN DI perspective, a BPMN diagram is a particular snapshot of a BPMN model at a certain point in time.
Multiple BPMN diagrams can be exchanged referencing model elements from the same BPMN model. Each diagram may
provide an incomplete or partial depiction of the content of the BPMN model. BPMN DI does not ascertain that the
BPMN diagram is syntactically or semantically correct.

As described in Section 15, a BPMN model package consists of one or more files. Each file may contain any number of
BPMN diagrams. The exporting tool is free to decide how many diagrams are exported and the importing tool is free to
decide if and how to present the contained diagrams to the user.

12.1.3 How to Read this Chapter

The normative BPMN 2.0 Diagram Interchange (BPMN DI) specification has three parts. Section 12.2 defines BPMN DI;
an instance of the DI meta-model provided at Annex B. Section 12.3 provides a library of the BPMN element depictions
and an unambiguous resolution between a referenced BPMN model element and its depiction. Finally, Section 12.4
provides examples to support the interpretation of the specification. Some BPMN diagram depictions along with their
XML BPMN DI serializations are provided.


12.2 BPMN Diagram Interchange (DI) Meta-model

12.2.1 Overview

The BPMN DI is an instance of the DI meta-model provided at Annex B. The basic concept of BPMN DI, as with DI in
general, is that serializing a diagram [BPMNDiagram] for interchange requires the specification of a collection of shapes
[BPMNShape] and edges [BPMNEdge] on a plane [BPMNPlane].

BPMNPlane, BPMNShape, and BPMNEdge MUST reference exactly one abstract syntax BPMN element from the
BPMN model using the bpmnElement attribute. The only exception is for a Data Association connected to a Sequence
Flow (See Figure 10.68). This is a visual short cut that actually normalizes two Data Associations within the BPMN
model. In this case, the resolution is made from the BPMN DI attributes rather than the abstract syntax reference
[bpmnElement] (See Table 12.35 - Depiction Resolution for Connecting Objects).

The BPMN DI classes only define the visual properties used for depiction. All other properties that are REQUIRED for
the unambiguous depiction of the BPMN element are derived from the referenced bpmnElement.

Multiple depictions of a specific BPMN element in a single diagram is NOT allowed, except for Participants in a
choreography (i.e., Participant Bands). For example, it is not allowed to depict a Task twice in the same diagram, but it
is allowed to depict the same Task in two different diagrams.

BPMN diagrams may be an incomplete or partial depiction of the content of the BPMN model. Some BPMN elements
from a BPMN model may not be present in any of the diagram instances being interchanged.

BPMN DI does not provide for any containment concept. The BPMNPlane is an ordered collection of mixed
BPMNShape(s) and BPMNEdge(s). The order of the BPMNShape(s) and BPMNEdge(s) inside a BPMNPlane determines
their Z-order (i.e., what is in front of what). BPMNShape(s) and BPMNEdge(s) that are meant to be depicted “on top” of
other BPMNShape(s) and BPMNEdge(s) MUST appear after them in the BPMNPlane. Therefore, the exporting tool
MUST order all BPMNShape(s) and BPMNEdge(s) such that the desired depiction can be rendered.

12.2.3.1 BPMNDiagram [Class]

BPMNDiagram is a kind of diagram that depicts all or part of a BPMN model.

Description
BPMNDiagram represents a depiction of all or part of a BPMN model. It specializes DI::Diagram and redefines the root
element (the top most diagram element) to be of type BPMNPlane. A BPMN diagram can also own a collection of
BPMNStyle elements that are referenced by BPMNLabel elements in the diagram. These style elements represent the
unique appearance styles used in the diagram.

12.2.3.2 BPMNPlane [Class]

A BPMNPlane is the BPMNDiagram container of BPMNShape and BPMNEdge.

Description
A BPMNPlane specializes DI::Plane and redefines its model element reference to be of type (BPMN) BaseElement. A
BPMNPlane can only reference a BaseElement of the types: Process, SubProcess, AdHocSubProcess, Transaction,
Collaboration, Choreography or SubChoreography.

BPMNPlane element is always owned by a BPMNDiagram and represents the root diagram element of that diagram. The
plane represents a 2 dimensional surface with an origin at (0, 0) along the x and y axes with increasing coordinates to the
right and bottom. Only positive coordinates are allowed for diagram elements that are nested in a BPMNPlane. This
means that the union of all the nested elements' bounds is deemed to be located at the plane's origin point.

12.2.3.3 BPMNShape [Class]

BPMNShape is a kind of shape that can depict a BPMN model element.

Description
BPMNShape represents a depiction of a (typically a node) BPMN model element. It specializes DI::LabeledShape and
redefines its model element reference to be of type (BPMN) BaseElement, allowing it to reference an element from a
BPMN model.

BPMNShape also contains an optional label of type BPMNLabel that can be nested in the shape when it has a visible
textual label with its own bounding box.

The shape also contains a number of normative notational options that can be specified for different types of BPMN
elements depicted by the shape. Those options, each represented by a separate property, and described below, allow for
recording the specific notational style desired for the shape.

All BPMNShape elements are owned directly by a BPMNPlane (that is the root element in a BPMNDiagram), i.e., shapes
are not nested within each other in the BPMN DI model although they may appear that way when depicted. The bounds
of a BPMNShape are always relative to that plane's origin point and are REQUIRED to be positive coordinates. Note that
the bounds’ x and y coordinates are the position of the upper left corner of the shape (relative to the upper left corner of
the plane).

Attributes
    • + isHorizontal : Boolean [0..1]

        an optional attribute that should be used only for Pools and Lanes. It determines if it should be depicted horizontally
        (true) or vertically (false).

    • + isExpanded : Boolean [0..1]

        an optional attribute that should be used only for SubProcess, AdHocSubProcess, Transaction, SubChoreographies ,

        an optional attribute that should only be used for Participant Bands. It is REQUIRED for a BPMNShape depicting a
        Participant Band. This is REQUIRED in order to relate the Participant Band to the BPMNShape depicting the
        Choreography Activity that this Participant Band is related to.

Associations
    • + bpmnElement : BaseElement [0..1] {redefines modelElement}

        a reference to a BPMN node element that this shape depicts. Note that although optional a bpmnElement must be
        provided for a BPMNShape.

12.2.3.4 ParticipantBandKind [Enumeration]

ParticipantBandKind defines the type of Participant Band to depict.

Description
Participant bands can be depicted in 3 ways:

      1.   a top band is rectangular with rounded corners at the top

      2.   a middle band is rectangular

      3.   a bottom band is rectangular with rounded corners at the bottom

Participant bands can be depicted in 2 shadings:

      1.   initiating (the band should not be shaded)

      2.   non_initiating (the band should be shaded)

Abstract Syntax
      • Figure 12.3 - BPMN Shape

Literals
      • top_initiating - the band should be depicted as a non shaded top band
      • middle_initiating - the band should be depicted as a non shaded middle band
      • bottom_initiating - the band should be depicted as a non shaded bottom band
      • top_non_initiating - the band should be depicted as a shaded top band
      • middle_ non_initiating - the band should be depicted as a shaded middle band
      • bottom_ non_initiating - the band should be depicted as a shaded bottom band

12.2.3.5 BPMNEdge [Class]

BPMNEdge is a kind of edge that can depict a relationship between two BPMN model elements.

Description
BPMNEdge represents a depiction of a relationship between two (source and target) BPMN model elements. It specializes
DI::LabeledEdge and redefines its model element reference to be of type (BPMN) BaseElement, allowing it to reference
a relationship element from a BPMN model.

BPMNEdge also redefines its source and target references to be of type DiagramElement (either BPMNShape or
BPMNEdge).

The source or target definition should only be present if the edge is depicted between a different source or target than the
one referenced by the BPMN model element of the BPMNEdge. Only the different source or target is REQUIRED. Both
attributes should be present only if both are different. This is the case, for instance, if a Message Flow target is not
depicted in the current diagram because it is inside a black box Pool. The Message Flow could then define its target as
being the BPMNShape depicting the Pool to connect it to the boundary of that black box Pool.

BPMNEdge also contains an optional label of type BPMNLabel that can be nested in the edge when it has a visible
textual label with its own bounding box.

All BPMNEdge elements are owned directly by a BPMNPlane (that is the root element in a BPMNDiagram). The
waypoints of BPMNEdge are always relative to that plane’s origin point and are REQUIRED to be positive coordinates.

    • + bpmnElement : BaseElement [0..1] {redefines modelElement}
             a reference to a connecting BPMN element that this edge depicts. Note that this reference is only optional for
             the specific case of a Data Association connected to a Sequence Flow; in all other cases a referenced element
             must be provided.

    • + sourceElement : DiagramElement [0..1] {redefines source}
             an optional reference to the edge’s source element if it is different from the source inferred from the
             bpmnElement association.

    • + targetElement : DiagramElement [0..1] {redefines target}
             an optional reference to the edge’s target element if it is different from the target inferred from the bpmnElement
             association.

    • messageVisibleKind : MessageVisibleKind [0..1]
             an optional attribute that should be used only for Message Flow. It determines if an envelope decorator should be
             depicted and the kind of envelope to be depicted.

12.2.3.6 MessageVisibleKind [Enumeration]

MessageVisibleKind defines the type of envelope that is visible.

Description
MessageVisibleKind is applicable only to Participant Band and Message Flow.

For Message Flow, the envelope should be positioned in the middle of the edge.

For Participant Band, the envelope should be positioned over (for top band) or under (for bottom band) and connected to
the band using an association. Note that only Choreography Task Participant Bands are allowed to show the envelope.
Middle bands being only used for a SubChoreography can thus not have envelope showing.

Abstract Syntax

Literals
      • initiating - The envelope should not be shaded.

      • non_inititating - The envelope should be shaded.

12.2.3.7 BPMNLabel [Class]
BPMNLabel is a kind of label that depicts textual info about a BPMN element.

Description
BPMNLabel represents a depiction of some textual information about a BPMN element. It specializes DI::Label and
redefines its style reference to be of type BPMNLabelStyle, which contains information about the appearance of the label
(e.g., the chosen font). The referenced style is owned by the diagram that nests the label.

A BPMN label is not a top-level element but is always nested inside either a BPMNShape or a BPMNEdge. It does not
have its own reference to a BPMN element but rather inherits that reference (if any) from its parent shape or edge. The
textual info depicted by the label is derived from that referenced BPMN element.

The bounds of BPMNLabel are always relative to the containing plane’s origin point. Note that the bounds’ x and y
coordinates are the position of the upper left corner of the label (relative to the upper left corner of the plane).

12.2.3.8 BPMNLabelStyle [Class]

BPMNLabelStyle is a kind of style that gives the appearance options for a BPMNLabel.

Description
BPMNLabelStyle represents the appearance options for elements of type BPMNLabel. It specializes DI::Style and
contains a description of a font that is used in depicting a BPMNLabel. One or more labels may reference the same
BPMNLabelStyle element, which must be owned by a BPMNDiagram.

12.3 Notational Depiction Library and Abstract Element Resolutions
As a notation, BPMN specifies the depiction for each of the BPMN elements.

Serializing a BPMN diagram for interchange requires the specification of a collection of BPMNShape(s) (see page 372)
and BPMNEdge(s) (see page 375) on the BPMNPlane (see page 371) of the BPMNDiagram (see page 370). The
BPMNShape(s) and BPMNEdge(s) attributes must be populated in such a way as to allow the unambiguous rendering of
the BPMN diagram by the receiving party. More specifically, the BPMNShape(s) and BPMNEdge(s) must reference

380                                                                          Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0
BPMN model element [bpmnElement]. If no bpmnElement is referenced or if the reference is invalid, it is expected that
this shape or edge should not be depicted. The only exception is for a Data Association connected to a Sequence Flow
(See Figure 10.68). This is a visual short cut that actually normalizes two Data Associations within the BPMN model. In
this case, the resolution is made from the BPMN DI attributes rather than the abstract syntax reference [bpmnElement]
(See Table 12.35 - Depiction Resolution for Connecting Objects).

When rendering a BPMN diagram, the correct depiction of a BPMNShape or BPMNEdge depends mainly on the
referenced BPMN model element [bpmnElement] and its particular attributes and/or references.

The purpose of this section is to: provide a library of the BPMN element depictions, and to provide an unambiguous
resolution between the referenced BPMN model element [bpmnElement], BPMNShape or BPMNEdge and their
depiction. Depiction resolution tables are provided below for both BPMNShape (Section 12.3.2) and BPMNEdge (Section
12.3.3).

12.3.1 Labels

Both BPMNShape and BPMNEdge may have labels (e.g., its name) placed inside the shape/edge, or above or below the
shape/edge, in any direction or location, depending on the preference of the modeler or modeling tool vendor.

Labels are optional for BPMNShape and BPMNEdge. When there is a label, the position of the label is specified by the
bounds of the BPMNLabel of the BPMNShape or BPMNEdge. Simply put, label visibility is defined by the presence of
the BPMNLabel element. The bounds of the BPMNLabel are optional and always relative to the containing BPMNPlane's
origin point (see page 376). The depiction resolution tables provided below exemplify default label positions for
BPMNShape kinds (Section 12.3.2) and BPMNEdge kinds (Section 12.3.3) if no BPMNLabel bounds are provided.

The text of the label to be rendered is obtained by resolving the name attribute of the referenced BPMN model element
[bpmnElement] from the BPMNShape or BPMNEdge. In the particular case when the referenced BPMN model element
[bpmnElement] is a DataObjectReference, the text of the label to be rendered is obtained by concatenating the name
attribute of the referenced BPMN model element [bpmnElement] and the name attribute of the dataState attribute of this
DataObjectReference (see Figure 12.6 - Depicting a Label for a DataObjectReference with its state).




 Label
[State]
Figure 12.6 - Depicting a Label for a DataObjectReference with its state

The properties of the font to be used for rendering the label are optional and provided by the labelStyle of the
BPMNLabel. If not provided, the tool should use its default style to depict the label.

12.3.2 BPMNShape

Markers for Activities

Various BPMN Activities can be decorated with markers at the bottom center of the shape.




Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0                                                                          381
Loop Characteristic markers may need to be rendered when the referenced BPMN model element [bpmnElement] of a
BPMNShape is a Task, ServiceTask, SendTask, ReceiveTask, UserTask, ManualTask, BusinessRuleTask, ScriptTask,
SubProcess, AdHocSubProcess, Transaction or CallActivity. Note that Loop Characteristic Markers (Loop, Multi-Instance
- Parallel and Multi-Instance - Sequential) are mutually exclusive markers. That is, only one of them can be present on a
single shape. See Table 10.8 - Depiction Resolution for Loop Characteristic Markers. Note that the patterns of Markers
depicted in Table 10.8 also apply to Transaction and Call Activity which have different border depictions (i.e., double
border or thick border).

A Compensation marker may need to be rendered when the referenced BPMN model element [bpmnElement] of a
BPMNShape is a Task, ServiceTask, SendTask, ReceiveTask, UserTask, ManualTask, BusinessRuleTask, ScriptTask,
SubProcess, AdHocSubProcess, Transaction or CallActivity. See Table 12.8 - Depiction Resolution for Compensation
Marker.

In the case of expandable kind of shapes, the markers (Compensation or Loop Characteristic) are placed to the left of the
+ on the shape.

The Compensation marker may be combined with a Loop Characteristic Marker. All the markers that are present must be
grouped and the whole group centered to the bottom of the shape. See Figure 12.7 - Combined Compensation and Loop
Characteristic Marker Example.

Note that in the case where the referenced BPMN model element [bpmnElement] of a BPMNShape is an
AdHocSubProcess, the shape has its tilde marker to the right of the + (See page 386).

Tasks [BPMNShape]

There are different types of Tasks identified within BPMN. The specific Task type depiction is obtained by placing a Task
type maker in the upper left corner of the Task shape. A Task that is no further specified is called an Abstract Task.

Tasks (Abstract, Service, Send, Receive, User, Manual, Business Rule or Script) can also have Compensation and/or Loop
Characteristic markers at the bottom center of the shape as defined above (see page 381).

Choreography Participant Bands [BPMNShape]

Participant Bands (used in Choreography shapes) are separate shapes that need to be separately defined. Individual
Participant Bands are rendered by separate BPMNShape. Each Participant Band referencing the corresponding participant.

Note that for Participant Bands with the envelope decorator, the envelope decorator should be depicted close to the band,
vertically centered with the band, and linked to the band using a dotted line. The name of the message may be used as a
label for the envelop decorator. BPMN DI does not provide an interchange of the bounds of the label of the envelope
decorator.

The bounds of the BPMNShape representing the band do not include the envelope decorator. The envelope decorator is
therefore outside of the BPMNShape bounds. BPMN DI does not provide an interchange of the bounds of the envelope
decorator.

12.3.3 BPMNEdge

Connecting Objects [BPMNEdge]

The target [targetElement] and source [sourceElement] of a BPMNEdge may be redefined when the depiction of the
source or target of the edge is different than the target [targetRef] and source [sourceRef] of the referenced model element
[bpmnElement] (e.g., Message flow finishing on the border of a black box Pool or a collapsed Sub-Process rather than the
actual Flow Node within the Pool or Sub-Process). In such case, the targetElement and/or sourceElement of the
BPMNEdge must point to the appropriate BPMNShape or BPMNEdge.




410                                                                                Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0
The source [sourceElement] and target [targetElement] of a BPMNEdge can never be a BPMNShape with
participantBandKind set (i.e., only Choreography Activity can be source or target of the BPMNEdge not the Participant
Bands).

Note that for Message Flow with an envelope decorator, the envelope decorator should be at the midpoint of the message
flow. BPMN DI does not provide an interchange of the bounds of the envelope decorator.

The “diamond” at the source of the Conditional Sequence Flow should not be depicted when the source of a Conditional
Sequence Flow is a Gateway. In other words, when the source of a Conditional Sequence Flow is a Gateway, the
Conditional Sequence Flow looks like a Sequence Flow.

Even though DataInputAssociation(s) and DataOutputAssociation(s) (Directed Data Associations) always point to
DataInput(s) or DataOutput(s) as sources or targets within the BPMN model, they are mostly depicted as starting or
finishing on the border of a different depicted element and thus, the target [targetElement] or source [sourceElement] of
the BPMNEdge must be specified.

12.4 Example(s)
This section provides examples to support interpretation of the BPMN DI specification. Some BPMN diagram depictions
along with their XML BPMN DI serializations are provided. The XML samples provided in this section present only
BPMN DI instances and omit the BPMN 2.0 abstract syntax.

For readability purposes, the bpmnElement that is referenced by the BPMNPlane, BPMNShape and BPMNEdge use a
representative string pattern. This string pattern is:

         BPMNModelClassName_BPMNModelNameAttributeValue

For example: “Task_Activity” for a Task named “Activity.”

In the provided XML serializations, the di namespace refers to the Diagram Interchange namespace defined in Annex B,
and the dc namespace refers to the Diagram Common namespace also defined in Annex B.

12.4.1 Depicting Content in a Sub-Process

This section shows various ways of depicting the content of a Sub-Process of the same BPMN model.

The BPMN model contains a process composed of a none start event (named “StartEvent”), a sub-process (named
“SubProcess”) and a none end event (named “EndEvent”). There is a sequence flow (named “a”) between the start event
(named “StartEvent”) and the sub-process (named “SubProcess”) and a sequence flow (named “d”) between the sub-
process (named “SubProcess”) and the end event (named “EndEvent”).

The sub-process (named “SubProcess”) is composed of a none start event (named “SubProcessStart”), an abstract task
(named “Activity”) and a none end event (named “SubProcessEnd”). There is a sequence flow (named “b”) between the
start event (named “SubProcessStart”) and the task (named “Activity”) and a sequence flow (named “c”) between the task
(named “Activity”) and the end event (named “SubProcessEnd”).

Expanded Sub-Process
First, a BPMN diagram depicts the BPMN model with the expanded sub-process showing its content (see Figure 12.8).
This leads to a BPMN DI serialization of a single diagram that depicts this process (see Table 12.37 - Expanded Sub-
Process BPMN DI instance).

Expanded Sub-Process with Start and End Events on Border

An alternative to depicting the same BPMN model of Section 12.4.1 would be to place the sub-process start and end
events on the border of the sub-process (see Figure 12.9). In the BPMN DI serialization of this diagram (see Table 12.40
- Expanded Sub-Process with Start and End Events on Border BPMN DI instance), the target of the sequence flow named
“a” and the source of the sequence flow named “d” are the start and end events on the boundary of the sub-process.

Compare the target of the sequence flow named “a” and the source of the sequence flow named “d” of Table 12.37 -
Expanded Sub-Process BPMN DI instance with that of Table 12.38 - Start and End Events on the Border BPMN DI
instance.

Collapsed Sub-Process

Alternatively, one could depict the same BPMN model of Section 12.4.1 as two diagrams. A first diagram (Figure 12.10)
depicts the process with the sub-process collapsed, while a second diagram (Figure 12.11) depicts the content of the sub-
process.

In this example, a Collaboration between two Participants (Pool A and Pool B) is depicted. The first Participant is
depicted with a white box Pool and the second Participant is depicted with a black box Pool. This diagram also depicts
message flows that are decorated with message envelopes (See Figure 12.13).
