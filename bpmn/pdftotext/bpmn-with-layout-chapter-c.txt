                                            Annex C: Glossary
                                                   (informative)


 A
 Activity                             Work that a company or organization performs using business processes. An activity
                                      can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The types of activities that are a part of a
                                      Process Model are: Process, Sub-Process, and Task.
 Abstract Process                     A Process that represents the interactions between a private business process and
                                      another process or participant.
 Artifact                             A graphical object that provides supporting information about the Process or
                                      elements within the Process. However, it does not directly affect the flow of the
                                      Process.
 Association                          A connecting object that is used to link information and Artifacts with Flow Objects.
                                      An association is represented as a dotted graphical line with an arrowhead to
                                      represent the direction of flow.
 Atomic Activity                      An activity not broken down to a finer level of Process Model detail. It is a leaf in the
                                      tree-structure hierarchy of Process activities. Graphically it will appear as a Task in
                                      BPMN.

 B
 Business Analyst                     A specialist who analyzes business needs and problems, consults with users and
                                      stakeholders to identify opportunities for improving business return through
                                      information technology, and defines, manages, and monitors the requirements into
                                      business processes.
 Business Process                     A defined set of business activities that represent the steps required to achieve a
                                      business objective. It includes the flow and use of information and resources.
 Business Process                     The services and tools that support process management (for example, process
 Management                           analysis, definition, processing, monitoring and administration), including support
                                      for human and application-level interaction. BPM tools can eliminate manual
                                      processes and automate the routing of requests between departments and
                                      applications.
 BPM System                           The technology that enables BPM.


 C
 Choreography                         An ordered sequence of B2B message exchanges between two or more Participants.
                                      In a Choreography there is no central controller, responsible entity, or observer of the
                                      Process.
 Collaboration                        Collaboration is the act of sending messages between any two Participants in a
                                      BPMN model. The two Participants represent two separate BPML processes.

Collapsed Sub-Process   A Sub-Process that hides its flow details. The Collapsed Sub-Process object uses a
                        marker to distinguish it as a Sub-Process, rather than a Task. The marker is a small
                        square with a plus sign (+) inside.
Compensation Flow       Flow that defines the set of activities that are performed while the transaction is being
                        rolled back to compensate for activities that were performed during the Normal Flow
                        of the Process. A Compensation Flow can also be called from a Compensate End or
                        Intermediate Event.
Compound Activity       An activity that has detail that is defined as a flow of other activities. It is a branch
                        (or trunk) in the tree-structure hierarchy of Process activities. Graphically, it will
                        appear as a Process or Sub-Process in BPMN.
Controlled Flow         Flow that proceeds from one Flow Object to another, via a Sequence Flow link, but
                        is subject to either conditions or dependencies from other flow as defined by a
                        Gateway. Typically, this is seen as a Sequence flow between two activities, with a
                        conditional indicator (mini-diamond) or a Sequence Flow connected to a Gateway.

D
Decision                A gateway within a business process where the Sequence Flow can take one of
                        several alternative paths. Also known as "Or-Split."

E
End Event               An Event that indicates where a path in the process will end. In terms of Sequence
                        Flows, the End Event ends the flow of the Process, and thus, will not have any
                        outgoing Sequence Flows. An End Event can have a specific Result that will appear
                        as a marker within the center of the End Event shape. End Event Results are Message,
                        Error, Compensation, Signal, Link, and Multiple. The End Event shares the same
                        basic shape of the Start Event and Intermediate Event, a circle, but is drawn with a
                        thick single line.
Event Context           An Event Context is the set of activities that can be interrupted by an exception
                        (Intermediate Event). This can be one activity or a group of activities in an expanded
                        Sub-Process.
Exception               An event that occurs during the performance of the Process that causes a diversion
                        from the Normal Flow of the Process. Exceptions can be generated by Intermediate
                        Events, such as time, error, or message.
Exception Flow          A Sequence Flow path that originates from an Intermediate Event attached to the
                        boundary of an activity. The Process does not traverse this path unless the Activity
                        is interrupted by the triggering of a boundary Intermediate Event (an Exception - see
                        above).
Expanded Sub-Process    A Sub-Process that exposes its flow detail within the context of its Parent Process.
                        An Expanded Sub-Process is displayed as a rounded rectangle that is enlarged to
                        display the Flow Objects within.

 Flow                                 A directional connector between elements in a Process, Collaboration, or
                                      Choreography. A Sequence Flows represents the sequence of Flow Objects in a
                                      Process or Choreography. A Message Flow represents the transmission of a Message
                                      between Collaboration Participants.The term Flow is often used to represent the
                                      overall progression of how a Process or Process segment would be performed.
 Flow Object                          A graphical object that can be connected to or from a Sequence Flow. In a Process,
                                      Flow Objects are Events, Activities, and Gateways. In a Choreography, Flow Objects
                                      are Events, Choreography Activities, and Gateways.
 Fork                                 A point in the Process where one Sequence Flow path is split into two or more paths
                                      that are run in parallel within the Process, allowing multiple activities to run
                                      simultaneously rather than sequentially. BPMN uses multiple outgoing Sequence
                                      Flows from Activities or Events or a Parallel Gateway to perform a Fork. Also
                                      known as “AND-Split.”

 I
 Intermediate Event                   An event that occurs after a Process has been started. An Intermediate Event affects
                                      the flow of the process by showing where messages and delays are expected,
                                      distributing the Normal Flow through exception handling, or showing the extra flow
                                      required for compensation. However, an Intermediate Event does not start or directly
                                      terminate a process. An Intermediate Event is displayed as a circle, drawn with a thin
                                      double line.

 J
 Join                                 A point in the Process where two or more parallel Sequence Flow paths are combined
                                      into one Sequence Flow path. BPMN uses a Parallel Gateway to perform a Join. Also
                                      known as “AND-Join.”

 L
 Lane                                 A partition that is used to organize and categorize activities within a Pool. A Lane
                                      extends the entire length of the Pool either vertically or horizontally. Lanes are often
                                      used for such things as internal roles (e.g., Manager, Associate), systems (e.g., an
                                      enterprise application), or an internal department (e.g., shipping, finance).

 M
 Merge                                A point in the Process where two or more alternative Sequence Flow paths are
                                      combined into one Sequence Flow path. No synchronization is required because no
                                      parallel activity runs at the join point. BPMN uses multiple incoming Sequence
                                      Flows for an Activity or an Exclusive Gateway to perform a Merge. Also know as
                                      “OR-Join.”
 Message                              An Object that depicts the contents of a communication between two Participants. A
                                      message is transmitted through a Message Flow and has an identity that can be used
                                      for alternative branching of a Process through the Event-Based Exclusive Gateway.
 Message Flow                         A Connecting Object that shows the flow of messages between two Participants. A
                                      Message Flow is represented by a dashed lined.

Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0                                                                                  501
Normal Flow                A flow that originates from a Start Event and continues through activities on
                           alternative and parallel paths until reaching an End Event.

P
Parent Process             A Process that holds a Sub-Process within its boundaries.
Participant                A business entity (e.g., a company, company division, or a customer) or a business
                           role (e.g., a buyer or a seller) that controls or is responsible for a business process. If
                           Pools are used, then a Participant would be associated with one Pool. In a
                           Collaboration, Participants are informally known as “Pools.”
Pool                       A Pool represents a Participant in a Collaboration. Graphically, a Pool is a container
                           for partitioning a Process from other Pools/Participants. A Pool is not required to
                           contain a Process, i.e., it can be a “black box.”
Private Business Process   A process that is internal to a specific organization and is the type of process that has
                           been generally called a workflow or BPM process.
Process                    A sequence or flow of Activities in an organization with the objective of carrying out
                           work. In BPMN, a Process is depicted as a graph of Flow Elements, which are a set
                           of Activities, Events, Gateways, and Sequence Flow that adhere to a finite execution
                           semantics.

R
Result                     The consequence of reaching an End Event. Types of Results include Message,
                           Error, Compensation, Signal, Link, and Multiple.

S
Sequence Flow              A connecting object that shows the order in which activities are performed in a
                           Process and is represented with a solid graphical line. Each Flow has only one source
                           and only one target. A Sequence Flow can cross the boundaries between Lanes of a
                           Pool but cannot cross the boundaries of a Pool.
Start Event                An Event that indicates where a particular Process starts. The Start Event starts the
                           flow of the Process and does not have any incoming Sequence Flow, but can have a
                           Trigger. The Start Event is displayed as a circle, drawn with a single thin line.
Sub-Process                A Process that is included within another Process. The Sub-Process can be in a
                           collapsed view that hides its details. A Sub-Process can be in an expanded view that
                           shows its details within the view of the Process that it is contained in. A Sub-Process
                           shares the same shape as the Task, which is a rectangle that has rounded corners.
Swimlane                   A Swimlane is a graphical container for partitioning a set of activities from other
                           activities. BPMN has two different types of Swimlanes. See “Pool” and “Lane.”

T
Task                       An atomic activity that is included within a Process. A Task is used when the work
                           in the Process is not broken down to a finer level of Process Model detail. Generally,
                           an end-user, an application, or both will perform the Task. A Task object shares the
                           same shape as the Sub-Process, which is a rectangle that has rounded corners.




502                                                                      Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0
 Token                                A theoretical concept that is used as an aid to define the behavior of a Process that is
                                      being performed. The behavior of Process elements can be defined by describing
                                      how they interact with a token as it “traverses” the structure of the Process. For
                                      example, a token will pass through an Exclusive Gateway, but continue down only
                                      one of the Gateway's outgoing Sequence Flow.
 Transaction                          A Sub-Process that represents a set of coordinated activities carried out by
                                      independent, loosely-coupled systems in accordance with a contractually defined
                                      business relationship. This coordination leads to an agreed, consistent, and verifiable
                                      outcome across all participants.
 Trigger                              A mechanism that detects an occurrence and can cause additional processing in
                                      response, such as the start of a business Process. Triggers are associated with Start
                                      Events and Intermediate Events and can be of the type: Message, Timer, Conditional,
                                      Signal, Link, and Multiple.

 U
 Uncontrolled Flow                    Flow that proceeds without dependencies or conditional expressions. Typically, an
                                      Uncontrolled Flow is a Sequence Flow between two Activities that do not have a
                                      conditional indicator (mini-diamond) or an intervening Gateway.
