7         Overview
There has been much activity in the past few years in developing web service-based XML execution languages for
Business Process Management (BPM) systems. Languages such as WSBPEL provide a formal mechanism for the
definition of business processes. The key element of such languages is that they are optimized for the operation and inter-
operation of BPM Systems. The optimization of these languages for software operations renders them less suited for
direct use by humans to design, manage, and monitor Business Processes. WSBPEL has both graph and block
structures and utilizes the principles of formal mathematical models, such as pi-calculus1. This technical underpinning
provides the foundation for business process execution to handle the complex nature of both internal and B2B interactions
and take advantage of the benefits of Web services. Given the nature of WSBPEL, a complex Business Process could
be organized in a potentially complex, disjointed, and unintuitive format that is handled very well by a software system
(or a computer programmer), but would be hard to understand by the business analysts and managers tasked to develop,
manage, and monitor the Process. Thus, there is a human level of “inter-operability” or “portability” that is not
addressed by these web service-based XML execution languages.

Business people are very comfortable with visualizing Business Processes in a flow-chart format. There are
thousands of business analysts studying the way companies work and defining Business Processes with simple flow
charts. This creates a technical gap between the format of the initial design of Business Processes and the format of
the languages, such as WSBPEL, that will execute these Business Processes. This gap needs to be bridged with a
formal mechanism that maps the appropriate visualization of the Business Processes (a notation) to the appropriate
execution format (a BPM execution language) for these Business Processes.

Inter-operation of Business Processes at the human level, rather than the software engine level, can be solved with
standardization of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). BPMN provides a multiple diagrams, which are
designed for use by the people who design and manage Business Processes. BPMN also provides a mapping to an
execution language of BPM Systems (WSBPEL). Thus, BPMN would provide a standard visualization mechanism for
Business Processes defined in an execution optimized business process language.

BPMN provides businesses with the capability of understanding their internal business procedures in a graphical notation
and will give organizations the ability to communicate these procedures in a standard manner. Currently, there are scores
of Process modeling tools and methodologies. Given that individuals will move from one company to another and that
companies will merge and diverge, it is likely that business analysts need to understand multiple representations of
Business Processes—potentially different representations of the same Process as it moves through its lifecycle of
development, implementation, execution, monitoring, and analysis. Therefore, a standard graphical notation will facilitate
the understanding of the performance Collaborations and business transactions within and between the organizations.
This will ensure that businesses will understand themselves and participants in their business and will enable
organizations to adjust to new internal and B2B business circumstances quickly. BPMN follows the tradition of
flowcharting notations for readability and flexibility. In addition, the BPMN execution semantics is fully formalized. The
OMG is using the experience of the business process notations that have preceded BPMN to create the next generation
notation that combines readability, flexibility, and expandability.

BPMN will also advance the capabilities of traditional business process notations by inherently handling B2B Business
Process concepts, such as public and private Processes and Choreographies, as well as advanced modeling
concepts, such as exception handling, transactions, and compensation.

Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0                                                                                        21
7.1       BPMN Scope
This specification provides a notation and model for Business Processes and an interchange format that can be used
to exchange BPMN Process definitions (both domain model and diagram layout) between different tools. The goal of
the specification is to enable portability of Process definitions, so that users can take Process definitions created in
one vendor’s environment and use them in another vendor’s environment.

The BPMN 2.0 specification extends the scope and capabilities of the BPMN 1.2 in several areas:

     • Formalizes the execution semantics for all BPMN elements

     • Defines an extensibility mechanism for both Process model extensions and graphical extensions

     • Refines Event composition and correlation

     • Extends the definition of human interactions

     • Defines a Choreography model

This specification also resolves known BPMN 1.2 inconsistencies and ambiguities.

BPMN is constrained to support only the concepts of modeling that are applicable to Business Processes. This means
that other types of modeling done by organizations for business purposes is out of scope for BPMN. Therefore, the
following are aspects that are out of the scope of this specification:

     • Definition of organizational models and resources

     • Modeling of functional breakdowns

     • Data and information models

     • Modeling of strategy

     • Business rules models

Since these types of high-level modeling either directly or indirectly affects Business Processes, the relationships
between BPMN and other high-level business modeling can be defined more formally as BPMN and other specifications
are advanced.

While BPMN shows the flow of data (Messages), and the association of data artifacts to Activities, it is not a data
flow language. In addition, operational simulation, monitoring and deployment of Business Processes are out of
scope of this specification.

BPMN 2.0 can be mapped to more than one platform dependent process modeling language, e.g. WS-BPEL 2.0. This
document includes a mapping of a subset of BPMN to WS-BPEL 2.0. Mappings to other emerging standards are
considered to be separate efforts.

The specification utilizes other standards for defining data types, Expressions and service operations. These standards
are XML Schema, XPath, and WSDL, respectively.

7.1.1    Uses of BPMN

Business Process modeling is used to communicate a wide variety of information to a wide variety of audiences.
BPMN is designed to cover many types of modeling and allows the creation of end-to-end Business Processes. The
structural elements of BPMN allow the viewer to be able to easily differentiate between sections of a BPMN Diagram.
There are three basic types of sub-models within an end-to-end BPMN model:

    • Processes (Orchestration), including:
         • Private non-executable (internal) Business Processes
         • Private executable (internal) Business Processes
         • Public Processes

    • Choreographies

    • Collaborations, which can include Processes and/or Choreographies
         • A view of Conversations

Private (Internal) Business Processes

Private Business Processes are those internal to a specific organization. These Processes have been generally
called workflow or BPM Processes (see Figure 10.4). Another synonym typically used in the Web services area is the
Orchestration of services. There are two (2) types of private Processes: executable and non-executable. An executable
Process is a Process that has been modeled for the purpose of being executed according to the semantics defined in
Chapter 14. Of course, during the development cycle of the Process, there will be stages where the Process does not
have enough detail to be “executable.” A non-executable Process is a private Process that has been modeled for the
purpose of documenting Process behavior at a modeler-defined level of detail. Thus, information needed for execution,
such as formal condition Expressions are typically not included in a non-executable Process.

If a swimlanes-like notation is used (e.g., a Collaboration, see below) then a private Business Process will be
contained within a single Pool. The Process flow is therefore contained within the Pool and cannot cross the
boundaries of the Pool. The flow of Messages can cross the Pool boundary to show the interactions that exist between
separate private Business Processes.


                                                                                           Notify
            Determine           Check              Determine            Approve
                                                                                         Applicant of
             Order is          Record of          Premium of           or Reject

Public Processes

A public Process represents the interactions between a private Business Process and another Process or
Participant (see Figure 7.2). Only those Activities that are used to communicate to the other Participant(s) are included
in the public Process. All other “internal” Activities of the private Business Process are not shown in the public
Process. Thus, the public Process shows to the outside world the Message Flows and the order of those Message
Flows that are needed to interact with that Process. Public Processes can be modeled separately or within a
Collaboration to show the flow of Messages between the public Process Activities and other Participants. Note
that the public type of Process was named “abstract” in BPMN 1.2.

Collaborations

A Collaboration depicts the interactions between two or more business entities. A Collaboration usually contains two
(2) or more Pools, representing the Participants in the Collaboration. The Message exchange between the
Participants is shown by a Message Flow that connects two (2) Pools (or the objects within the Pools). The
Messages associated with the Message Flows can also be shown. The Collaboration can be shown as two or more
public Processes communicating with each other (see Figure 7.3). With a public Process, the Activities for the
Collaboration participants can be considered the “touch-points” between the participants. The corresponding internal
(executable) Processes are likely to have much more Activity and detail than what is shown in the public Processes.
Or a Pool MAY be empty, a “black box.” Choreographies MAY be shown “in between” the Pools as they bisect the
Message Flows between the Pools. All combinations of Pools, Processes, and a Choreography are allowed in a
Collaboration.

Choreographies

A self-contained Choreography (no Pools or Orchestration) is a definition of the expected behavior, basically a
procedural contract, between interacting Participants. While a normal Process exists within a Pool, a Choreography
exists between Pools (or Participants).

The Choreography looks similar to a private Business Process since it consists of a network of Activities,
Events, and Gateways (see Figure 7.4). However, a Choreography is different in that the Activities are interactions
that represent a set (1 or more) of Message exchanges, which involves two (2) or more Participants. In addition, unlike
a normal Process, there is no central controller, responsible entity or observer of the Process.

Conversations

The Conversation diagram is a particular usage of and an informal description of a Collaboration diagram. However,
the Pools of a Conversation usually do not contain a Process and a Choreography is usually not placed in
between the Pools of a Conversation diagram. A Conversation is the logical relation of Message exchanges. The
logical relation, in practice, often concerns a business object(s) of interest, e.g., “Order,” “Shipment and Delivery,” or
“Invoice.”

Message exchanges are related to each other and reflect distinct business scenarios. For example, in logistics, stock
replenishments involve the following types scenarios: creation of sales orders; assignment of carriers for shipments
combining different sales orders; crossing customs/quarantine; processing payment and investigating exceptions. Thus, a
Conversation diagram, as shown in Figure 7.5, shows Conversations (as hexagons) between Participants (Pools).
This provides a “bird’s eye” perspective of the different Conversations which relate to the domain.

Diagram Point of View

Since a BPMN Diagram MAY depict the Processes of different Participants, each Participant could view the Diagram
differently. That is, the Participants have different points of view regarding how the Processes will apply to them. Some
of the Activities will be internal to the Participant (meaning performed by or under control of the Participant) and other

Activities will be external to the Participant. Each Participant will have a different perspective as to which are internal
and external. At runtime, the difference between internal and external Activities is important in how a Participant can
view the status of the Activities or trouble-shoot any problems. However, the Diagram itself remains the same. Figure
7.3 displays a Business Process that has two points of view. One point of view is of a Patient, the other is of the
Doctor’s office. The Diagram shows the Activities of both participants in the Process, but when the Process is
actually being performed, each Participant will only have control over their own Activities. Although the Diagram point
of view is important for a viewer of the Diagram to understand how the behavior of the Process will relate to that
viewer, BPMN will not currently specify any graphical mechanisms to highlight the point of view. It is open to the
modeler or modeling tool vendor to provide any visual cues to emphasize this characteristic of a Diagram.

Understanding the Behavior of Diagrams

Throughout this document, we discuss how Sequence Flows are used within a Process. To facilitate this discussion,
we employ the concept of a token that will traverse the Sequence Flows and pass through the elements in the
Process. A token is a theoretical concept that is used as an aid to define the behavior of a Process that is being
performed. The behavior of Process elements can be defined by describing how they interact with a token as it
“traverses” the structure of the Process. However, modeling and execution tools that implement BPMN are NOT
REQUIRED to implement any form of token.

A Start Event generates a token that MUST eventually be consumed at an End Event (which MAY be implicit if not
graphically displayed). The path of tokens should be traceable through the network of Sequence Flows, Gateways,
and Activities within a Process.

Note – A token does not traverse a Message Flow since it is a Message that is passed down a Message Flow (as the
name implies).


7.2       BPMN Elements
It should be emphasized that one of the drivers for the development of BPMN is to create a simple and understandable
mechanism for creating Business Process models, while at the same time being able to handle the complexity inherent
to Business Processes. The approach taken to handle these two conflicting requirements was to organize the
graphical aspects of the notation into specific categories. This provides a small set of notation categories so that the reader
of a BPMN diagram can easily recognize the basic types of elements and understand the diagram. Within the basic
categories of elements, additional variation and information can be added to support the requirements for complexity
without dramatically changing the basic look and feel of the diagram. The five (5) basic categories of elements are:

    • Flow Objects
    • Data
    • Connecting Objects
    • Swimlanes
    • Artifacts



Flow Objects are the main graphical elements to define the behavior of a Business Process. There are three (3) Flow
Objects:

    • Events
    • Activities


Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0                                                                                   27
     • Gateways

Data is represented with the four (4) elements:

     • Data Objects
     • Data Inputs
     • Data Outputs
     • Data Stores

There are four (4) ways of connecting the Flow Objects to each other or other information. There are four (4) Connecting
Objects:

     • Sequence Flows
     • Message Flows
     • Associations
     • Data Associations

There are two (2) ways of grouping the primary modeling elements through “Swimlanes:”

     • Pools
     • Lanes

Artifacts are used to provide additional information about the Process. There are two (2) standardized Artifacts,
but modelers or modeling tools are free to add as many Artifacts as necessary. There could be additional BPMN
efforts to standardize a larger set of Artifacts for general use or for vertical markets. The current set of Artifacts
includes:

     • Group
     • Text Annotation

Table 7.1 - Basic Modeling Elements

 Element                 Description                                              Notation
 Event                   An Event is something that “happens” during the
                         course of a Process (see page 242) or a Choreog-
                         raphy (see page 346). These Events affect the flow
                         of the model and usually have a cause (trigger) or
                         an impact (result). Events are circles with open
                         centers to allow internal markers to differentiate
                         different triggers or results. There are three types
                         of Events, based on when they affect the flow:
                         Start, Intermediate, and End.
 Activity                An Activity is a generic term for work that company
                         performs (see page 153) in a Process. An Activity
                         can be atomic or non-atomic (compound). The
                         types of Activities that are a part of a Process
                         Model are: Sub-Process and Task, which are
                         rounded rectangles. Activities are used in both
                         standard Processes and in Choreographies.

 Gateway                 A Gateway is used to control the divergence and
                         convergence of Sequence Flows in a Process (see
                         page 147) and in a Choreography (see page 351).
                         Thus, it will determine branching, forking, merging,
                         and joining of paths. Internal markers will indicate
                         the type of behavior control.
 Sequence Flow           A Sequence Flow is used to show the order that
                         Activities will be performed in a Process (see page
                         97) and in a Choreography (see page 326).
 Message Flow            A Message Flow is used to show the flow of Mes-
                         sages between two Participants that are prepared
                         to send and receive them (see page 119). In
                         BPMN, two separate Pools in a Collaboration Dia-
                         gram will represent the two Participants (e.g., Part-
                         nerEntities and/or PartnerRoles).
 Association             An Association is used to link information and Arti-
                         facts with BPMN graphical elements (see page
                         67). Text Annotations (see page 72) and other Arti-
                         facts (see page 66) can be Associated with the
                         graphical elements. An arrowhead on the Associa-
                         tion indicates a direction of flow (e.g., data), when
                         appropriate.
 Pool                    A Pool is the graphical representation of a Partici-
                         pant in a Collaboration (see page 110). It also acts
                         as a “swimlane” and a graphical container for parti-
                                                                                   Name




                         tioning a set of Activities from other Pools, usually
                         in the context of B2B situations. A Pool MAY have
                         internal details, in the form of the Process that will
                         be executed. Or a Pool MAY have no internal
                         details, i.e., it can be a "black box."

                           nize and categorize Activities.


 Data Object               Data Objects provide information about what Activ-
                           ities require to be performed and/or what they pro-
                           duce (see page 209), Data Objects can represent
                           a singular object or a collection of objects. Data
                           Input and Data Output provide the same informa-
                           tion for Processes.
 Message                   A Message is used to depict the contents of a com-
                           munication between two Participants (as defined
                           by a business PartnerRole or a business Partner-
                           Entity—see on page 93).

 Group (a box around a     A Group is a grouping of graphical elements that
 group of objects within   are within the same Category (see page 71). This
 the same category)        type of grouping does not affect the Sequence
                           Flows within the Group. The Category name
                           appears on the diagram as the group label. Cate-
                           gories can be used for documentation or analysis
                           purposes. Groups are one way in which Catego-
                           ries of objects can be visually displayed on the dia-
                           gram.



 Text Annotation           Text Annotations are a mechanism for a modeler to

 Event                        An Event is something that “happens” during
                              the course of a Process (see page 242) or a
                              Choreography (see page 346). These Events
                              affect the flow of the model and usually have
                              a cause (Trigger) or an impact (Result).
                              Events are circles with open centers to allow
                              internal markers to differentiate different Trig-
                              gers or Results. There are three types of
                              Events, based on when they affect the flow:
                              Start, Intermediate, and End.

 Start, Intermediate, End)


 Start                        As the name implies, the Start Event indicates
                              where a particular Process (see page 242) or
                              Choreography (see page 346) will start.

 Intermediate                 Intermediate Events occur between a Start
                              Event and an End Event. They will affect the
                              flow of the Process (see page 254) or Chore-
                              ography (see page 347), but will not start or

Table 7.2 - BPMN Extended Modeling Elements

 Activity                An Activity is a generic term for work that
                         company performs (see page 153) in a Pro-
                         cess. An Activity can be atomic or non-atomic
                         (compound). The types of Activities that are a
                         part of a Process Model are: Sub-Process
                         and Task, which are rounded rectangles.
                         Activities are used in both standard Pro-
                         cesses and in Choreographies.

 Task (Atomic)           A Task is an atomic Activity that is included
                         within a Process (see page 158). A Task is
                         used when the work in the Process is not bro-
                         ken down to a finer level of Process detail.
                                                                                       Task
                                                                                       Name

 Choreography Task       A Choreography Task is an atomic Activity in
                         a Choreography (see page 329). It represents                Participant A
                         a set of one (1) or more Message exchanges.                Choreography
                         Each Choreography Task involves two (2)                     Task Name
                         Participants. The name of the Choreography
                         Task and each of the Participants are all dis-
                         played in the different bands that make up the              Participant B
                         shape’s graphical notation. There are two (2)
                         or more Participant Bands and one Task
                         Name Band.

 Process/Sub-Process     A Sub-Process is a compound Activity that is
 (non-atomic)            included within a Process (see page 175) or
                         Choreography (see page 334). It is compound           See Next Four (4) Figures
                         in that it can be broken down into a finer level
                         of detail (a Process or Choreography) through
                         a set of sub-Activities.

 Collapsed Sub-Process   The details of the Sub-Process are not visible
                         in the Diagram (see page 175). A “plus” sign
                         in the lower-center of the shape indicates that
                         the Activity is a Sub-Process and has a lower-            Sub-Process
                         level of detail.                                             Name


 Expanded Sub-Process    The boundary of the Sub-Process is
                         expanded and the details (a Process) are visi-
                         ble within its boundary (see page 175).
                         Note that Sequence Flows cannot cross the
                         boundary of a Sub-Process.

 Gateway                   A Gateway is used to control the divergence
                           and convergence of Sequence Flows in a
                           Process (see page 292) and in a Choreogra-
                           phy (see page 351). Thus, it will determine
                           branching, forking, merging, and joining of
                           paths. Internal markers will indicate the type
                           of behavior control (see below).

 Gateway Control Types     Icons within the diamond shape of the Gate-
                           way will indicate the type of flow control
                           behavior. The types of control include:

                                 exclusive decisions and merging.            Event-Based
                                 Exclusive can be shown with or without
                                 the “X” marker.

Table 7.2 - BPMN Extended Modeling Elements

 Sequence Flow           A Sequence Flow is used to show the order
                         that Activities will be performed in a Process
                                                                              See next seven figures
                         (see page 97) and in a Choreography (see
                         page 326).

 Normal Flow             Normal flow refers paths of Sequence Flow
                         that do not start from an Intermediate Event
                         attached to the boundary of an Activity.

 Uncontrolled flow       Uncontrolled flow refers to flow that is not
                         affected by any conditions or does not pass
                         through a Gateway. The simplest example of
                         this is a single Sequence Flow connecting two
                         Activities. This can also apply to multiple
                         Sequence Flows that converge to or diverge
                         from an Activity. For each uncontrolled
                         Sequence Flows a token will flow from the
                         source object through the Sequence Flows
                         to the target object.

 Conditional flow        A Sequence Flow can have a condition
                         Expression that are evaluated at runtime to
                         determine whether or not the Sequence Flow
                         will be used (i.e., will a token travel down the
                         Sequence Flow – see page 97). If the condi-
                         tional flow is outgoing from an Activity, then
                         the Sequence Flow will have a mini-diamond
                         at the beginning of the connector (see figure
                         to the right). If the conditional flow is outgoing
                         from a Gateway, then the line will not have a
                         mini-diamond (see figure in the row above).

 Default flow            For Data-Based Exclusive Gateways or Inclu-
                         sive Gateways, one type of flow is the Default
                         condition flow (see page 97). This flow will be
                         used only if all the other outgoing conditional
                         flow is not true at runtime. These Sequence
                         Flows will have a diagonal slash will be
                         added to the beginning of the connector (see
                         the figure to the right).

 Exception Flow          Exception flow occurs outside the normal flow
                         of the Process and is based upon an Interme-
                         diate Event attached to the boundary of an
                         Activity that occurs during the performance of
                         the Process (see page 292).

                                                                                    Flow

Table 7.2 - BPMN Extended Modeling Elements

 Message Flow              A Message Flow is used to show the flow of
                           Messages between two Participants that are
                           prepared to send and receive them (see page
                           119). In BPMN, two separate Pools in a Col-
                           laboration Diagram will represent the two Par-
                           ticipants (e.g., PartnerEntities and/or
                           PartnerRoles).

 Compensation              Compensation Association occurs outside the
 Association               normal flow of the Process and is based upon
                           a Compensation Intermediate Event that is
                           triggered through the failure of a transaction
                           or a throw Compensation Event (see page
                           308). The target of the Association MUST be
                           marked as a Compensation Activity.                Compensation
                                                                              Association



 Data Object               Data Objects provide information about what                Data Object
                           Activities require to be performed and/or what
                           they produce (see page 209), Data Objects
                           can represent a singular object or a collection
                           of objects. Data Input and Data Output pro-

 Message                   A Message is used to depict the contents of a

                           defined by a business PartnerRole or a
                           business PartnerEntity—see on page 93).

Table 7.2 - BPMN Extended Modeling Elements

 Fork                    BPMN uses the term “fork” to refer to the
                         dividing of a path into two or more parallel
                         paths (also known as an AND-Split). It is a
                         place in the Process where activities can be
                         performed concurrently, rather than sequen-
                         tially.

                         There are two options:

                             • Multiple Outgoing Sequence Flows can
                               be used (see figure top-right). This
                               represents “uncontrolled” flow is the
                               preferred method for most situations.
                             • A Parallel Gateway can be used (see
                               figure bottom-right). This will be used
                               rarely, usually in combination with other
                               Gateways.




 Join                    BPMN uses the term “join” to refer to the com-
                         bining of two or more parallel paths into one
                         path (also known as an AND-Join or synchro-
                         nization).

                         A Parallel Gateway is used to show the joining
                         of multiple Sequence Flows.




 Decision, Branching     Decisions are Gateways within a Process
 Point                   (see page 292) or a Choreography (see page
                                                                           See next five rows.
                         351) where the flow of control can take one or
                         more alternative paths.

 Exclusive               This Decision represents a branching point
                         where Alternatives are based on conditional
                                                                                             Condition 1
                         Expressions contained within the outgo-
                         ing Sequence Flows (see page 295 or page
                         351). Only one of the Alternatives will be cho-
                         sen.

                                                                                                 Default

 Event-Based               This Decision represents a branching point
                           where Alternatives are based on an Event
                           that occurs at that point in the Process (see
                           page 302) or Choreography (see page 356).
                           The specific Event, usually the receipt of a
                           Message, determines which of the paths will
                           be taken. Other types of Events can be used,
                           such as Timer. Only one of the Alternatives
                           will be chosen.

                           There are two options for receiving Mes-
                           sages:
                               • Tasks of Type Receive can be used
                                 (see figure top-right).
                               • Intermediate Events of Type Message
                                 can be used (see figure bottom-right).




 Inclusive                 This Decision represents a branching point
                           where Alternatives are based on conditional        Condition 1
                           Expressions contained within the outgo-
                           ing Sequence Flows (see page 297).
                           In some sense it is a grouping of related inde-
                           pendent Binary (Yes/No) Decisions. Since
                           each path is independent, all combinations of
                           the paths MAY be taken, from zero to all.
                           However, it should be designed so that at
                           least one path is taken. A Default Condition
                           could be used to ensure that at least one path     Condition 2
                           is taken.

                           There are two versions of this type of Deci-         Condition 1
                           sion:
                               • The first uses a collection of conditional
                                 Sequence Flows, marked with mini-
                                 diamonds (see top-right figure).
                                                                                 Condition 2
                               • The second uses an Inclusive Gateway
                                 (see bottom-right picture).




Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0                                                      37
Table 7.2 - BPMN Extended Modeling Elements

 Merging                 BPMN uses the term “merge” to refer to the
                         exclusive combining of two or more paths into
                         one path (also known as an OR-Join).
                         A Merging Exclusive Gateway is used to show
                         the merging of multiple Sequence Flows (see
                         upper figure to the right).
                         If all the incoming flow is alternative, then a
                         Gateway is not needed. That is, uncontrolled
                         flow provides the same behavior (see lower
                         figure to the right).




 Looping                 BPMN provides 2 (two) mechanisms for loop-
                         ing within a Process.
                                                                            See Next Two Figures
 Activity Looping        The attributes of Tasks and Sub-Processes
                         will determine if they are repeated or per-
                         formed once (see page 194). There are two
                         types of loops: Standard and Multi-Instance. A
                         small looping indicator will be displayed at the
                         bottom-center of the activity.

 Sequence Flow Looping   Loops can be created by connecting a
                         Sequence Flow to an “upstream” object. An
                         object is considered to be upstream if that
                         object has an outgoing Sequence Flow that
                         leads to a series of other Sequence Flows,
                         the last of which is an incoming Sequence
                         Flow for the original object.

 Multiple Instances            The attributes of Tasks and Sub-Processes                               Sequential
                               will determine if they are repeated or per-
                               formed once (see page 195). A set of three
                               (3) horizontal liness will be displayed at the
                               bottom-center of the activity for sequentail
                               Multi-Instances (see upper figure to the right).
                               A set of three (3) vertical liness will be dis-
                               played at the bottom-center of the activity for
                               sequentail Multi-Instances (see lower figure to
                               the right).                                                              Parallel

                               Process Break Artifact, as designed by a
                               modeler or modeling tool, can be associated
                               with the Event to highlight the location of the
                               delay within the flow.

 Transaction                   A transaction is a Sub-Process that is sup-
                               ported by a special protocol that insures that
                               all parties involved have complete agreement
                               that the activity should be completed or can-
                               celled (see page 180). The attributes of the
                               activity will determine if the activity is a trans-
                               action. A double-lined boundary indicates that
                               the Sub-Process is a Transaction.

 Nested/Embedded Sub-      A nested (or embedded) Sub-Process is an
 Process (Inline Block)    activity that shares the same set of data as its
                           parent process (see page 175). This is               There is no special indicator for nested Sub-
                           opposed to a Sub-Process that is indepen-                            Processes
                           dent, re-usable, and referenced from the par-
                           ent process. Data needs to be passed to the
                           referenced Sub-Process, but not to the nested
                           Sub-Process.

 Group (a box around a     A Group is a grouping of graphical ele-
 group of objects within   ments that are within the same Category
 the same category)        (see page 69). This type of grouping does not
                           affect the Sequence Flows within the Group.
                           The Category name appears on the diagram
                           as the group label. Categories can be used for
                           documentation or analysis purposes. Groups
                           are one way in which Categories of objects
                           can be visually displayed on the diagram.




 Off-Page Connector        Generally used for printing, this object will
                           show where a Sequence Flow leaves one
                           page and then restarts on the next page. A
                           Link Intermediate Event can be used as an
                           Off-Page Connector.



 Association               An Association is used to link information and
                           Artifacts with BPMN graphical elements (see
                           page 67). Text Annotations (see page 72) and
                           other Artifacts (see page 66) can be Associ-
                           ated with the graphical elements. An arrow-
                           head on the Association indicates a direction
                           of flow (e.g., data), when appropriate.

 Text Annotation           Text Annotations are a mechanism for a mod-

 ciation)                  the reader of a BPMN Diagram (see page 72).

 Pool                      A Pool is the graphical representation of a
                           Participant in a Collaboration (see page 110).
                           It also acts as a “swimlane” and a graphical
                                                                              Name

                           situations. A Pool MAY have internal details,
                           in the form of the Process that will be exe-
                           cuted. Or a Pool MAY have no internal details,
                           i.e., it can be a "black box."

 Lanes                       A Lane is a sub-partition within a Pool and will

                             Lanes are used to organize and categorize
                             Activities.



7.3      BPMN Diagram Types
The BPMN 2.0 aims to cover three basic models of Processes: private Processes (both executable and non-
executable), public Processes, and Choreographies. Within and between these three BPMN sub-models, many types
of Diagrams can be created. The following are examples of Business Processes that can be modeled using BPMN
2.0:

    • High-level non-executable Process Activities (not functional breakdown)
    • Detailed executable Business Process
    • As-is or old Business Process
    • To-be or new Business Process
    • A description of expected behavior between two (2) or more business Participants—a Choreography.
    • Detailed private Business Process (either executable or non-executable) with interactions to one or more external
      Entities (or “Black Box” Processes)
    • Two or more detailed executable Processes interacting
    • Detailed executable Business Process relationship to a Choreography
    • Two or more public Processes
    • Public Process relationship to Choreography
    • Two or more detailed executable Business Processes interacting through a Choreography

BPMN is designed to allow describing all above examples of Business Processes. However, the ways that different
sub-models are combined is left to tool vendors. A BPMN 2.0 compliant implementation could RECOMMEND that
modelers pick a focused purpose, such as a private Process, or Choreographies. However, the BPMN 2.0
specification makes no assumptions.


7.4      Use of Text, Color, Size, and Lines in a Diagram
Text Annotation objects can be used by the modeler to display additional information about a Process or attributes of
the objects within a BPMN Diagram.
          BPMN elements (e.g. Flow objects) MAY have labels (e.g., its name and/or other attributes) placed inside the shape,
         or above or below the shape, in any direction or location, depending on the preference of the modeler or modeling
         tool vendor.
         The fills that are used for the graphical elements MAY be white or clear.
             The notation MAY be extended to use other fill colors to suit the purpose of the modeler or tool (e.g., to
             highlight the value of an object attribute). However,
                  The markers for “throwing” Events MUST have a dark fill (see “End Event” on page 250 and “Intermediate


Business Process Model and Notation, v2.0                                                                                 41
                 Event” on page 254 for more details).
                 Participant Bands for Choreography Tasks and Sub-Choreographies that are not the initiator of the Activity
                 MUST have a light fill (see “Choreography Task” on page 329 and “Sub-Choreography” on page 334 for
                 more details).
         Flow objects and markers MAY be of any size that suits the purposes of the modeler or modeling tool.
         The lines that are used to draw the graphical elements MAY be black.
             The notation MAY be extended to use other line colors to suit the purpose of the modeler or tool (e.g., to
             highlight the value of an object attribute).
             The notation MAY be extended to use other line styles to suit the purpose of the modeler or tool (e.g., to
             highlight the value of an object attribute) with the condition that the line style MUST NOT conflict with any
             current BPMN defined line style. Thus, the line styles of Sequence Flows, Message Flows, and Text
             Associations MUST NOT be modified or duplicated.


7.5      Flow Object Connection Rules
An incoming Sequence Flow can connect to any location on a Flow Object (left, right, top, or bottom). Likewise, an
outgoing Sequence Flow can connect from any location on a Flow Object (left, right, top, or bottom). A Message
Flow also has this capability. BPMN allows this flexibility; however, we also RECOMMEND that modelers use
judgment or best practices in how Flow Objects should be connected so that readers of the Diagrams will find the
behavior clear and easy to follow. This is even more important when a Diagram contains Sequence Flows and
Message Flows. In these situations it is best to pick a direction of Sequence Flows, either left to right or top to
bottom, and then direct the Message Flows at a 90° angle to the Sequence Flows. The resulting Diagrams will be
much easier to understand.

7.5.1    Sequence Flow Connections Rules

Table 7.3 displays the BPMN Flow Objects and shows how these objects can connect to one another through Sequence
Flows. These rules apply to the connections within a Process Diagram and within a Choreography Diagram. The
symbol indicates that the object listed in the row can connect to the object listed in the column. The quantity of
connections into and out of an object is subject to various configuration dependencies are not specified here. Refer to the
sections in the next chapter for each individual object for more detailed information on the appropriate connection rules.
Note that if a Sub-Process has been expanded within a Diagram, the objects within the Sub-Process cannot be
connected to objects outside of the Sub-Process. Nor can Sequence Flows cross a Pool boundary.

Only those objects that can have incoming and/or outgoing Sequence Flows are shown in the table. Thus, Pool, Lane,
Data Object, Group, and Text Annotation are not listed in the table. Also, the Activity shapes in the table represent
Activities and Sub-Processes for Processes, and Choreography Activities and Sub-Choreographies for
Choreography.

7.5.2    Message Flow Connection Rules

Table 7.4 displays the BPMN modeling objects and shows how these objects can connect to one another through
Message Flows. These rules apply to the connections within a Collaboration Diagram. The                symbol indicates that
the object listed in the row can connect to the object listed in the column. The quantity of connections into and out of an
object is subject to various configuration dependencies are not specified here. Refer to the sections in the next chapter for
each individual object for more detailed information on the appropriate connection rules. Note that Message Flows
cannot connect to objects that are within the same Pool.

Only those objects that can have incoming and/or outgoing Message Flows are shown in the table. Thus, Lane,
Gateway, Data Object, Group, and Text Annotation are not listed in the table.


7.6      BPMN Extensibility
BPMN 2.0 introduces an extensibility mechanism that allows extending standard BPMN elements with additional
attributes. It can be used by modelers and modeling tools to add non-standard elements or Artifacts to satisfy a
specific need, such as the unique requirements of a vertical domain, and still have valid BPMN Core. Extension attributes
MUST NOT contradict the semantics of any BPMN element. In addition, while extensible, BPMN Diagrams should still
have the basic look-and-feel so that a Diagram by any modeler should be easily understood by any viewer of the Diagram.
Thus the footprint of the basic flow elements (Events, Activities, and Gateways) MUST NOT be altered.

The specification differentiates between mandatory and optional extensions (Section 8.2.3 explains the syntax used to
declare extensions). If a mandatory extension is used, a compliant implementation MUST understand the extension. If an
optional extension is used, a compliant implementation MAY ignore the extension.
