Annex A: Changes from v1.2
(informative)

A.1 Changes from BPMN, v1.2
There have been notational and technical changes to the BPMN specification.
The major notational changes include:
• The addition of a Choreography diagram
• The addition of a Conversation diagram
• Non-interrupting Events for a Process
• Event Sub-Processes for a Process
The major technical changes include:
• A formal metamodel as shown through the class diagram figures
• Interchange formats for abstract syntax model interchange in both XMI and XSD
• Interchange formats for diagram interchange in both XMI and XSD
• XSLT transformations between the XMI and XSD formats
Other technical changes include:
• Reference Tasks are removed. These provided reusability within a single diagram, as compared to GlobalTasks, which
are resuable across multiple diagrams. GlobalTasks can be used instead of Reference Tasks, to simplify the language
and implementations."
